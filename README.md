# aff-net_DockerSetup

## About this code

I have created a dockerfile to build affordance-net on docker. This dockerfile uses a (altered version of the code)[https://github.com/hongtaowu67/affordance-net]. In other words, it builds a virtual environment of cuda10.2-cudnn7-ubuntu18.

I would like to thank the all developers of affordance-net.I hope this file will be useful to someone!
